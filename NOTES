TODO allow multiple lines to be evaluated in a function
TODO create scheme init file, move all possible functions there
TODO increase reader robustness (newline)
TODO add support for rationals, floating point, and bigint
TODO add support for continuations
TODO add support for macros (common lisp style)
TODO add garbage collection

OK, I'm going to work on multi-line evals. I'm going to just use the evallist
function and return the last value. Alternatively, I could just use begin
and hardcode it into the few functions that need to eval multiple expressions.
What expressions are those? define, lambda, let[*|rec] ... Actually, that
might be it.




An analysis of the shortcuts taken so far:

If this is to evolve into an efficient interpreter, I will need to know which
portions I've cut corners on and attempt to make them more efficient.

Perhaps the most glaring aspect is the fact that every time an object is allocated, malloc() is called. In addition to this, you won't find a call to
free() anywhere. Programs that rely on the efficiency of the garbage collector
have already lost the efficiency battle, but we can still make sure that
memory usage remains reasonable.

In order to create a new object, that object has to come from somewhere. There
are two options in this regard: obtain memory from the OS every time, or keep
a pool of objects that can be used.
