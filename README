Hello.

The reason why I even have a README file is that I've decided to give GitHub a
try, and thus am going to be making this repository public.

I've been Scheming for about 3 years now and it's my preferred language for
developing my own throwaway software, so I decided to try my hand at writing
and interpreter in C, and what you see is the result of that effort.

This is not intended to be anything more than my learning the finer points of
C and Scheme. Also, while this is now publicly hosted on GitHub, I have not
gone through the process of choosing a distribution license as I don't
think any code here has any tangible value.

One other thing - this is also where I have done some experimentation and
learning Git, so the history of this project is filled with random forks and
merges. Please ignore them.



Thanks for visiting!
